The new buddies in the town.

*This article only intends to highlight the ease of access to a Linux terminal on Windows Machines and does not aim at breaking the hearts of Linux admirers. PS: I admire Linux too.*

Let me start this blog by telling you why I mentioned "Indian" in the title. As far as I perceived the Indian educational institutions, I've always seen Windows Machines everywhere. The labs, receptions, the data operations department everything runs on Windows. Even the servers that I noticed were Windows Servers.

[I have no idea about schools in other countries, so let me limit to India here.]

Now its no wonder that a typical Indian developer who learned to use a computer in such conditions is accustomed to the Windows ecosystem. Moreover, it's heartbreaking to leave the well-established ecosystem for Linux. I know Linux has its perks but you can't remove the familiarity aspect from Windows.

## Windows Fans' struggle with Linux

Sure we struggle with it. You either spin up a Virtual Machine and run a Linux system with some laggy response times or Dual Boot your PC and pray the bootloader gods to successfully boot your PC.

Go Arch Linux with Dual Boot and you're there sitting for hours trying to figure out stuff which might sometimes make you think about your life decisions.

You get some luck with Hyper-V if you have Windows 10 Pro and let's not start on Virtual Box and VM Ware (sometimes) laggy performance.

## "WSL was introduced in 2016. You are late into the business boy."

Oh! Yes. I'm late. Now let's talk why now?

I've always been jealous of Mac users for having a system well built on Unix but now I'm not. I always knew developers use Linux workstations for their work and wanted to change to one. But nostalgia stopped me.

So, on the fine evening of 19th March, I decided to migrate to Linux. Dammit, it was hard to move and my mind was somehow not prepared for the Dual Boot extravagance. Then I stumbled upon wsl in VS Code. And Eureka! That's what I wanted. Got into the PC Settings and turned the Linux sweetness.

## Somethings are Broken : (

Although it's been 2 years since the launch of this subsystem. There are still certain hiccups here and there.

The subsystem can currently only access CPU of the Host system. So no CUDA here (Sorry TensorFlow/PyTorch peeps. You gotta wait.). Add a vote [here](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/266908-command-prompt-console-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windo/suggestions/16108045-opencl-cuda-gpu-support) so we can keep pushing the Windows team to work on this.

Another thing is if you are a Python developer, the VS Code extension for Python doesn't work with WSL. On the positive side, there is an open issue on the GitHub page for it. You can visit it [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/67). Consider contributing if possible.

I'm sure there are some more too but my experience is limited to these cases. It would be great if you share your experiences too.

## Why can't WE fix them?

One thing that the whole developer community is feeling bad about WSL is that it isn't open source (yet). The moment Microsoft open sources the system there would be an enormous number of brains working on the subsystem (Including mine). Until then, we gotta wait for Microsoft's engineers to do their work and admire their work.

## Hope for better support

We know it's somewhat distant from an established Linux machine but the steps are quite impressive and I can't wait to train some Neural Networks on the WSL with CUDA enabled.
