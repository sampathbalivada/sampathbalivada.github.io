Android Studio to Flutter - As smooth as the gradient

Let's start with the real reason behind changing from Android Studio to Flutter. Android Studio is great, I agree - but not for everything. Let's list out all the reasons behind my shift.

### Cross-platform

Flutter is cross-platform. Build it once and you're done. The current application that I am working on may have users who use different platforms and Flutter is great at delivering the same. Write once use many - Justified.

### Dart is simple yet powerful

As soon as I wanted to try I Flutter, the first thing that struck me is my familiarity with Java. I had a semester-long course on Java and now I shift to a new language Dart?

But trust me, Dart is simple, Just in case you're familiar with Java, C# or any similar languages, going Dart is as simple as knowing the structure.

### You only need one Language

Flutter works with only one language. Gone are the days to code layouts using XML and then code in Java/Kotlin (Go Kotlin). Write all of it in Dart and you're done. All it needs is a call to your desired function using the onPressed attribute. At a glance, the visual appearance and functionality of Widgets (the building blocks in Flutter) can be deciphered or defined just by seeing or writing the code in one language.

### Everything is modular. Is this LEGO?

Everything that used in Flutter is a widget. This really improves the code reusability even for the UI elements. Need the same form that you created for the Sign Up page? Import the file and include the widget within your Stateful or Stateless Widget. As simple as that. The powerful refactor tool also improves code readability.

## The Verdict

Although Android Studio is designed to develop apps not only for smartphones, Flutter is promising and can be a huge timesaver if the approach to the app is simple yet needs to be responsive. It's nice to mention that Flutter is still in beta and needs a lot of work but on the other hand Android Studio is mature and polished already. These solutions, in reality, are siblings and it's nice to see Flutter grow up as [Fuchsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fuchsia) takes charge. Flutter Live had some exciting things on the house and I can't wait for the HummingBird Project. Where's Google I/O when we need it?
